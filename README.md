# 🖐️ AI-Based Virtual Mouse with Real-Time Hand Gesture Control

Welcome to my project repository showcasing a **Virtual Mouse Interface** powered entirely by hand gestures using a standard webcam. This project is a practical demonstration of blending **Computer Vision**, **AI**, and **Human-Computer Interaction** to create touchless, accessible interfaces.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system uses hand tracking to:

- Capture hand gestures via webcam
- Detect key finger landmarks
- Translate gestures into mouse actions like cursor movement and clicks

All of this happens **in real-time**, without needing a physical mouse!

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – Real-time video frame capture and image processing  
- **MediaPipe** – Accurate hand landmark detection  
- **PyAutoGUI** – Automates mouse movement and clicks  
- **NumPy** – Used for coordinate interpolation and transformation  

## 🎯 Core Features

- 👉 **Index Finger Tracking**: Move your hand to move the cursor
- 🤏 **Pinch to Click**: Thumb + index finger gesture triggers mouse click
- 🪟 **Window Agnostic**: Works across apps like Chrome, VS Code, etc.
- 🖼️ **Live Overlay**: Real-time hand tracking overlay using OpenCV
- ⚙️ **Topmost Window**: Persistent interface that stays on screen during tab switch
- 🧠 **Gesture-based control** for an intuitive HCI experience

## 🔮 Future Scope

- ✋ Multi-finger gesture detection  
- 🔄 Gesture-based scrolling and drag support  
- 🧠 ML-powered gesture classification for custom actions  
- 🎮 Integration with games or custom applications  

## 📌 Why This Project?

This hands-free Virtual Mouse aims to explore the **future of interaction**, where users can interact with systems **without touch**, especially useful in:
- Accessibility tools  
- Healthcare kiosks  
- Smart TVs  
- AR/VR environments  
- Clean environments (labs, surgery, etc.)
